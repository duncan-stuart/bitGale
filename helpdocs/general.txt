---bitGale Help---
Welcome to bitGale!

bitGale uses a basic command-line interface through which you run the various effects. To run an effect on your image,
simply type the name of that effect. Each effect has additional options, which you can specify by adding in the flag
for that option, followed by the value you want to use.

 - Flags are optional! Every flag will have a value it defaults to if not specified, so if you
    > Ex: bitGale~: effect -flag1 flag1Value -flag2 flag2Value...


 - For effect-specific help, type: 'help -eff [effect]' (or help -eff list for a list of all effects)
    > This will tell you what that specific effect does, and the flags associated with it.

You can use the 'show' command to view your image anytime, and the 'save' command to save your image after you are done
editing.
